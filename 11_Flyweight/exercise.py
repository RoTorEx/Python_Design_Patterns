"""Flyweight pattern task

Given a Sentence class whose constructor takes a string (such as "hello world").

You need to implement the API in such a way that the indexer returns a flyweight through which you can translate
specific words from the string to uppercase. Here is an example of using such an API:

sentence = Sentence('hello world')
sentence[1].capitalize = True
print(sentence) # writes 'hello WORLD'"""


"""
# *Start template
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, plain_text):
        pass
        # ToDo
"""


# ?Solution
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, plain_text):
        pass
        # ToDo
